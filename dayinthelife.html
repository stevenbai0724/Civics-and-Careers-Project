	<p>Most software engineers work on weekdays, Monday to Friday, in a cozy, air conditioned and heated office.</p>
	<p>Software engineers live the 9-5 lifestyle. Most of the work that software engineers do involves coding.</p>
	<p>Engineers usually have a meeting before working, debriefing the work that is to be done that day</p>
	<p>Software engineers enjoy a wide variety of activities at work. Other than just coding, they also attend meetings, write reports and help colleagues with computer related issues.</p>
	<p>Software engineers will take breaks after coding for a while to stretch and relieve stress, as well as to prevent any musculoskeletal issues related with posture.</p>
	<p>Some Software engineers take breaks every 2-3 hrs and do physical activities for a few mins such as playing ping pong, having a nerf war, etc.</p>
	<p>Like many office jobs, software engineers take a 30 min - 1 hr lunch break and continue working.</p>
	<p>Most Software Engineers pack up and leave work at around 5:00</p>
	<p>Engineers may have to do some coding outside of work but otherwise they live a very free lifestyle at home.</p>
