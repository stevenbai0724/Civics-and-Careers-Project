	<p>Most software developers work on weekdays, Monday to Friday, in a cozy, air conditioned and heated office.</p>
	<p>Different companies start at different times but software developers usually get to work at 8-8:30 and start shortly after. Most of the work that software developers do involves coding.</p>
	<a class = "go_back" href = "main_page.html">For more information on what software developers do, go to the main page here</a>
	<p>Developers usually have a meeting before working, debriefing the work that is to be done that day</p>
	<p>Software developers enjoy a wide variety of activities at work. Other than just coding, they also attend meetings, write reports and help colleagues with computer related issues.</p>
	<p>Stereotypically, software developers are antisocial and "nerdy" people but they are actually required to actively collaborate and discuss issues with co-workers and clients. Being a software developer can be a very interactive job!</p>
	<p>Although some companies may have different rules and traditions, most software developers will take breaks after coding for a while to stretch and relieve stress, as well as to prevent any musculoskeletal issues related with posture.</p>
	<p>Developers and many other coding-related workers take breaks every 2-3 hrs and do fun physical activities for a few mins such as playing ping pong, having a nerf war, etc.</p>
	<p>Like many office jobs, software developers take a 30 min - 1 hr lunch break and continue working.</p>
	<p>Developers end work at different times depending on the company, usually somewhere from 3:30 - 5:00.</p>
	<p>Developers may have to do some coding outside of work but otherwise they live a very free lifestyle at home.</p>
